# Night-in-the-Woods
A game based on the play 'A Night in the Woods' written and performed by members of YTM 14-19.

I'm not 100% sure what the game will be about and it's more of an excuse to learn the bevy game engine properly but it might end up being good.
License is MIT so feel free to do whatever you want with this.

The play was divised by YTM 14-19 over several months. It was directed by Sarah Fielding and performed by members of the group on 25th June 2023.
